## Azure-Reviews-A-Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-Approach


###  Background and Objective:

My objective is to leverage the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Topic Modeling technique to analyze the textual data aggregated from a particualr high impact reviews platform, capterra.com to uncover key trends that matter to users of the product. 


### Business Case Argument:

In today's competitive cloud market, understanding customer sentiment is crucial. LDA analysis of product reviews provides a data-driven approach to decipher user feedback at scale. For giants like Microsoft Azure or AWS, where customer feedback is vast and varied, manual analysis is impractical. LDA offers an automated, efficient method to distill vast amounts of feedback into actionable insights. By implementing LDA, these companies can enhance product development, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase market share and revenue.



### Value Proposition of LDA Analysis on Cloud Product Reviews:

- Uncover Hidden Themes: LDA can identify latent topics in reviews, revealing what customers are specifically talking about, whether it's performance, pricing, features, or support.

- Prioritize Product Development: By identifying common topics, companies can prioritize which features or issues need immediate attention, ensuring resources are allocated effectively.

- Enhanced Customer Support: Discover recurring issues or challenges faced by users, enabling customer support to proactively address and resolve them.

- Competitive Analysis: Understand how your product stands against competitors. If reviews consistently highlight a feature that competitors lack, it's a unique selling point.

- Marketing Insights: Understanding users' most valued features can inform marketing strategies, enabling targeted campaigns emphasizing those strengths.

- User Segmentation: By understanding different topics, companies can segment users based on their needs or challenges, leading to more personalized communication and product offerings.


LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is a NLP (Natural Language Processing) technique. Specifically, it's a topic modeling technique used to discover the latent topics that are present in a collection of text documents.

In NLP, LDA is employed to understand the main topics in large volumes of text, making it easier to summarize or categorize documents based on their content. Given a set of documents, LDA tries to determine the mix of topics that each document represents and the mix of words that define each topic. LDA is a powerful tool in the NLP toolkit for uncovering the hidden thematic structure in a large collection of texts.
