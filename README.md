## Azure-Reviews-A-Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-Approach


###  Background and Objective:

In this project, I attempt to explore the world of text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the context of Microsoft Azure cloud reviews. My objective is to leverage the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Topic Modeling technique to analyze the textual data aggregated from a particualr high impact reviews platform, capterra.com to uncover key trends that maatter to users of the product.


LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is a NLP (Natural Language Processing) technique. Specifically, it's a topic modeling technique used to discover the latent topics that are present in a collection of text documents.

In NLP, LDA is employed to understand the main topics in large volumes of text, making it easier to summarize or categorize documents based on their content. Given a set of documents, LDA tries to determine the mix of topics that each document represents and the mix of words that define each topic. LDA is a powerful tool in the NLP toolkit for uncovering the hidden thematic structure in a large collection of texts.
